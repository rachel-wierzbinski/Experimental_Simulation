#### Environment
The environment file creates the game canvas. It also generates and moves obstacles. These obstacles are captured and stored in a multidimensional array.

#### Agent
The agent file creates a player. The player perform actions such as jumping and crouching. Actions and their respective logic are handled in this file. Below is our agent!

#### Visualize_State
The visualize_state file graphically represents the game canvas, obstacles, and the player created in the environment and agent files described above. The user is able to make our player, Zeke, jump to avoid obstacles by pressing the space bar. Below is the game!
